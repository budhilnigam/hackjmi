    Review:
      "Participating in the Hack'JMI and winning the Best Healthcare project was an exhilarating journey that revolved around the creation of our innovative solution, Glucobot. Our team embarked on a mission to revolutionize glucose monitoring, utilizing advanced Near Infrared (NIR) technology and the Beer-Lambert Law to develop a non-invasive glucometer.The hackathon commenced with a buzz of excitement as teams gathered to address real-world challenges in the many sectors. Inspired by the opportunity to make a significant impact, our diverse team, comprising experts in technology, healthcare, and user experience, quickly coalesced around the idea of creating a cutting-edge solution for glucose monitoring.The conceptualization phase involved in-depth research into existing glucose monitoring technologies and an exploration of the challenges faced by individuals managing diabetes. We identified a critical need for a non-invasive glucometer that could provide accurate readings without the discomfort and risks associated with traditional methods.Our project harnessed the power of advanced NIR technology, coupled with the scientific principles of the Beer-Lambert Law, to create a glucometer that could deliver precise and reliable glucose level readings. The innovation lay not only in the technology but also in the user experience. Glucobot was accompanied by a user-friendly app, accessible remotely from any location with internet connectivity. One of the standout features of Glucobot was its non-invasive nature. By eliminating the need for skin breakage, our solution addressed several concerns prevalent in traditional glucose monitoring methods. Users no longer had to grapple with the fear of needles, potential infections, or repeated damage to skin cells from frequent testing. Glucobot's approach not only enhanced user comfort but also prioritized overall safety. Challenges were met with collaborative problem-solving, and each team member played a crucial role in bringing Glucobot to life. When it came time to present our project to the judges, the excitement and nerves were palpable. As we showcased the capabilities of Glucobot, highlighting its technological innovation, user benefits, and potential impact on diabetes management, the positive response from the judges further fueled our enthusiasm. Winning the best healthcare project at the Hack’JMI was a moment of triumph for our team. It validated the countless hours of research, development, and collaboration that went into creating Glucobot. Beyond the accolades, the victory opened doors to potential partnerships, funding opportunities, and the chance to further refine and implement our solution in the real world.The experience was a reminder that even in a short timeframe, a dedicated team can develop transformative solutions that have the potential to improve lives and make a lasting impact on healthcare practices",
